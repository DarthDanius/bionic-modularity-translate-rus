  <BM_SpacerHighExplosiveBurstAbilityModule.label>high-explosive burst module</BM_SpacerHighExplosiveBurstAbilityModule.label>
  <BM_SpacerHighExplosiveBurstAbilityModule.description>A high-tech device that can be installed into any compatible artificial arm or leg replacement. This particular module is capable of producing a powerful explosion around its user by releasing a concoction of volatile chemicals through vent-like openings. While the host is shielded from the blast, any nearby allies or structures will be affected. Syncing with other modules of the same kind allows it to work with greater efficiency.</BM_SpacerHighExplosiveBurstAbilityModule.description>
