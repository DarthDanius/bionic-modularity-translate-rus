  <BM_SpacerProcessorSubpersonaChip.description>An advanced brain implant designed to assist the user in research tasks and act as a digital encyclopedia on that and any similar subject. The subpersona can quickly and accurately analyze devices, substances and documents while also being able to perform complex calculations in fractions of a second.\n\nA brain implant of such complexity requires time to synchronize with and adapt to its host in order to avoid excessive strain on the central nervous system, its effectiveness will slowly increase during this process. It's capable of syncing with other enhancements made to assist in similar tasks, greatly increasing efficiency.</BM_SpacerProcessorSubpersonaChip.description>
