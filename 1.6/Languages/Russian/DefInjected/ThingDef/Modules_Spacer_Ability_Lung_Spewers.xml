  <BM_SpacerSmokeSpewerAbilityModule.description>A high-tech device that can be installed into any compatible artificial lung replacement. This particular module produces and mixes specialized chemicals that can be sent through the airways and launched out of the mouth or nose. The resulting chemical reaction creates a wave of smoke. While the substances by themselves pose no risk for the host, the module provides no protection against the gas produced by combining them. Syncing with other modules of the same kind allows it to work with greater efficiency.</BM_SpacerSmokeSpewerAbilityModule.description>
